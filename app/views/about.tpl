		<h3>Turtlestitch</h3>

<p>is based on a browser-based educational programming language (Snap!) to
generate patterns for embroidery machines. It is easy to use, requiring no
prior knowledge in programming, yet powerful in creating nowels patterns
for embroidery. It is usefull for designers to experiment with
generative aesthetics and precision embroidery as well as tool for
innovative workshops combining an introduction to programing with haptic
output. </p>

<p>Turtlestitch uses Snap!s "pen module" which it interprets as a needle
and transforms its output into widely-used embroidery file formats.</p>

<h3>About Snap!</h3> 

<p>Snap!  is a visual, drag-and-drop programming language that allows
students to create interactive stories, animations, games, and more,
while learning about mathematical and computational ideas. Snap! was
inspired by Scratch, but also targets both novice and more advanced
students by including and expanding Scratch's features.</p>

<p>Snap! is developed by the University of California, Berkeley with the
support from the National Science Foundation, MioSoft, and the
CommunicationDesign Group at SAP Labs.<br />
The design of Snap! is influenced and inspired by Scratch, from Lifelong
Kindergarten group at the MIT Media Lab. For more information see<br />
